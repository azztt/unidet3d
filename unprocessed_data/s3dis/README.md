### Preparation of S3DIS Data for Indoor Detection

Please follow original mmdetection3d [instruction](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/22aaa47fdb53ce1870ff92cb7e3f96ae38d17f61/data/s3dis). However, to match the order of points in each scene with our superpoints it will be needed to run `remap_superpoints.py` script.
